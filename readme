This is my attempt at the portfolio project in the Free Code Camp front-end web development course.

From https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage
User Story: I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

User Story: I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

User Story: I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use placeholders.)

User Story: I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.
